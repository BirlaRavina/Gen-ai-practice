text = """A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies for each project separately.
It prevents conflicts between projects and avoids affecting the system-wide Python installation Tools like venv or virtualenv are commonly used to create them.

Why do we need a Virtual Environment
Avoid Dependency Conflicts: Different projects may require different versions of the same library (e.g., Django 4.0 vs 4.1).
Isolate Project Environments: Keeps each projectâ€™s packages and settings separate from others and from the system Python.

Simplifies Project Management: Makes it easier to manage and replicate project-specific setups.
Prevents System Interference: Avoids accidentally modifying or breaking the global Python environment.
Enables Reproducibility: Ensures consistent behavior across development, testing and deployment environments.
When and Where to use a Virtual Environment?
