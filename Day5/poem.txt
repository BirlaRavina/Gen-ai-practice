ðŸŒ¿ Whispers of Nature ðŸŒ¿

In morningâ€™s light the meadows gleam,
A painterâ€™s stroke, a poetâ€™s dream.
The dew-kissed leaves, the rustling trees,
Sing ancient songs upon the breeze.

The river hums a silver tune,
Reflecting stars and chasing moon.
The mountains rise with silent grace,
Time-worn guardians of this place.

A robin's call, a rustling deer,
Soft symphonies for all who hear.
No need for words, no grand displayâ€”
Just nature's truth in calm array.

So pause awhile, let stillness grow,
And feel the earthâ€™s eternal flow.
For in her arms, we find our partâ€”
A beating world, a beating heart.
