Day 3: Data Structures and Algorithms
Understanding arrays and linked lists
Stacks, queues, and deques
Hash tables
Binary search trees
Recursion
Sorting algorithms (like quicksort, mergesort, etc.)
Questions for Review:
1. Explain the difference between arrays and linked lists.
2. How would you implement a queue in Python?
3. Describe a real-world application of a hash table.
4. What is a binary search tree and how does it work?
5. Provide an example of a recursive function in Python.
6. Explain the basic idea behind the mergesort algorithm.
7. How does a deque differ from a stack or a queue?
8. What is a binary heap and how is it used in sorting?
9. Describe the concept of memoization in the context of recursion.
10. Implement a simple search algorithm in Python.
